# 1. Lobster abundance and fishing pressure (2012 - 2017)
# Describe trends in lobster abundance (counts) and fishing pressure (trap buoys) at the five locations from 2012 - 2017. Ignore transect information - we are only interested in evaluating abundance and pressure on the order of SITE. Note: you are not expected to use regression here - just think of ways to clearly describe annual totals visually and in text, noting important trends, events and differences.

# Exploring trends in lobster counts between sites

# summary table of some statistics by site called sites_sizes
sites_sizes <- lobster_size_tidied %>% 
  group_by(SITE) %>% 
  summarize(count=n())
