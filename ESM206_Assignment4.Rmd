##Introduction## 

The California Spiny Lobster, Panulirus interruptus, is a marine crustacean found along the coast from Point Conception in Santa Barbara County to the US-Mexican border.$^3$ Lobster fishing in this area has a deep history and continues today. The spiny lobster is the only invertebrate in California that is subject to both a significant recreational and commercial fishery.$^1$ In an effort to study and understand the impacts of human activities on coastal ecosystems, Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research conducted a study on the California Spiny Lobster.$^6$ Data including lobster abundance and size was gathered at various giant kelp forest ecosystems sites along the southern California coast. 

Lobster abundance is simply measured as a count. In the Long Term Ecological Research study, lobster abundance and size were both measured. Abundance can be affected by a multitude of factors, including predation. The spiny lobster is prey for various marine species including giant sea bass, California sheephead, cabezon, horn shark, leopard shark, octopus and sea otter.$^2$ Humans are also predators and have been catching lobsters for hundreds of years. 
Documented lobster fishing in the region between Santa Barbara County and the US-Mexican border has been recorded since the late 1800s.$^1$ By the 1900s, lobster counts were decreasing significantly. Preliminary measures were enacted to limit rapid decline in population due to human forces. These regulations included seasonal fishing and size limits for catch.$^1$ 
Size limitations are still enforced. 

Lobster size is an important ecological factor. The body length of the lobster larva is about 1.4 mm at at the first stage of its development and about 29 mm at the final larva development stage.$^7$ This measurement is taken along the anterior body segment, or carapace, from the edge of the eye socket to the rear edge of the carapace.$^2$ Once a juvenile hatches, carapace length increases about 3.1 mm after each molt (shedding of the old exoskeleton).$^7$ Juveniles reach approximately 24 mm after 1 year and 44 mm after 2 years. A length of 82.6 mm is expected after sexual maturity, at approximately 7 to 10 years.$^7$ This 82.6 mm value has been established as the legal limit for lobster catch. Once lobsters have reached this size, fishermen can keep the lobster, whereas any smaller lobsters must be released back to the ocean. The minimum size limit was established with the intent to allow each lobster to reproduce at least once before it is captured.$^2$ In the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research study, a range of carapace sizes were observed in various sites.$^5$ 

Multiple sites were defined and observed in the Santa Barbara Long Term Ecological Research study involving the California Spiny Lobster. Our analysis focuses on five of the sites: Arroyo Quemado (AQUE), Naples Reef (NAPL), Mohawk Reef (MOHK), Isla Vista (IVEE), Carpinteria (CARP). Lobster size and abundance was observed and recorded at each of the sites from 2012-08-20 to 2017-08-25 (5). Two of the sites, Naples and Isla Vista, are located in the California Fish and Game Network of Marine Protected Areas (MPA).$^5$ MPAs are defined marine or estuarine areas designed to protect or conserve marine life and habitat. According to NOAA’s MPA inventory database, Naples’ primary conservation focus is natural heritage. Commercial and recreational fishing are restricted year round. The Isla Vista site is listed as Campus Point State Marine Conservation Area in the NOAA database. The protection focus is the ecosystem, and commercial and recreational fishing are also restricted year round.$^4$ Major revisions and additions to Southern California MPAs went into effect in state waters on January 1, 2012. Both Naples and Isla Vista were established as MPAs on this date. 

##Data and Methods##

Data was provided from the SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster from years 2012 to 2017. Fishing pressure was determined through counted number of fishing trap floats recorded in five locations(Isla Vista, Naples, Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk Reef, and Carpinteria) two of which are designated Marine Protected Areas (Isla Vista and Naples). Observations were collected every 2 to 4 weeks during lobster fishing season (October to March). Abundance and size data was recorded annually by divers in the months immediately prior to the start of lobster fishing season.

![**Figure 1.** Map of locations from which data on Spiny Lobsters was collected](lobster_map.png)

Lobster abundance (measured by counts of individuals) fishing pressure (measured by number of trap buoys) and lobster size (measured by mean carapace length) were analyzed to determine trends and significant differences across the 5 locations. The state of California’s South Coast Supplemental Fishing Report on Spiny Lobster was used to compare impacts of fishing pressure in MPA and non-MPA locations before and after their implementation in 2012. Data analysis and visualizations were performed in R-Studio statistical software (v. 1.1.456), Microsoft Word (v. 16.18), and Preview (v. 10.1).

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

# 1. Lobster abundance and fishing pressure (2012 - 2017)
# Describe trends in lobster abundance (counts) and fishing pressure (trap buoys) at the five locations from 2012 - 2017. Ignore transect information - we are only interested in evaluating abundance and pressure on the order of SITE. Note: you are not expected to use regression here - just think of ways to clearly describe annual totals visually and in text, noting important trends, events and differences.

########## Exploring trends in lobster counts and traps between sites##########

  summarize("count"=n())

lobster_trap_plot <- ggplot(lobster_trap_summary, aes(x=YEAR,y=count))+

```

##Results and Discussion##

####*Trends in Lobster Abundance and Fishing Pressure between 2012 and 2017*####

Trends in lobster abundance were compared against trends in fishing pressure and appear to be inversely related. When fishing pressure decreased, lobster abundance increased. This is reasonable to assume given fishing by its very nature removes individuals from the populations studied and therefore decreases measurements of abundance. The most notable differences were observed at Carpinteria and Isla Vista. This can be attributed to a 37.5% decrease in fishing pressure at both locations from 2016-2017 which allowed populations to more than triple.

####*Trends in Mean Lobster Size*####

Mean carapace length (mm) of Spiny Lobsters differed significantly accross the 5 sites studied for the year 2017 (one-way ANOVA, F(4, 1663) = 3.42, *p* = 0.009, $\alpha$ = 0.05). Post-hoc analysis with Tukey's HSD ($\alpha$ = 0.05) revealed that the Naples location differed significantly with Carpinteria and Isla Vista (pairwise *p* = 0.023, and pairwise *p* = 0.004, respectively). This is consistent with the marked decrease in fishing pressure prior to 2017 in Carpinteria and Isla Vista compared to Naples where population abundance and fishing pressure remained relatively flat. The goal of supporting population growth by limiting fishing appears to be supported by this data.

```{r echo = FALSE, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "**Figure 3. Mean Lobster Size by Location** Observations of mean Spiny Lobster size as measured by carapace length (millimeters) accross all 5 locations studied for the year 2017.

####*Impact of MPA Status On Spiny Lobster Size*####

One MPA site and one non-MPA site experienced a significant difference in Spiny Lobster size as measured by mean carapace length in millimeters (Table 1 and Table 2, respectively). All Spiny Lobster populations experienced growth over the 5 year period with the exception of those sampled from Carpinteria and Mohawk Reef who showed diminishing average size by 2.13 mm and 5.25 mm, respectively.  
```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

# 3. Changes in lobster size at MPA and non-MPA sites (comparing only 2012 and 2017 sizes)
# From the data description (http://sbc.lternet.edu/cgi-bin/showDataset.cgi?docid=knb-lter-sbc.77):
# “Data on abundance, size and fishing pressure of California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) are collected along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. Spiny lobsters are an important predator in giant kelp forests off southern California. Two SBC LTER study reefs are located in or near the California Fish and Game Network of Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Naples and Isla Vista, both established as MPAs on 2012-01-01. MPAs provide a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of fishing on kelp forest community dynamics. Sampling began in 2012 and is ongoing.”
